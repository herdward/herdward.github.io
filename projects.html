            <div class="project-title">Dynamic Personal AI Assistant (Full-Stack AI + Infra Deployment)</div>
                <div class="project-desc">
                  • Designed and deployed sophisticated multi-agent AI assistant using LangGraph orchestration with 6+ specialized agents including Security Agent , Security Explanation Agent, Intent Classifier, and Persona Manager for contextual threat detection and conversation management.<br>
                  • Engineered multi-source knowledge base blending structured data, personal project lore, and adaptive personas to simulate natural dialogue across professional, technical, and personal domains with comprehensive security-first architecture.<br>
                  • Implemented advanced multi-agent reasoning system using custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, intent classification, tone modulation, and persona switching with multi-model fallback system and automatic quota management.<br>
                  • Built sophisticated threat modeling system with multi-layered defense: input sanitization, AI-powered threat detection, and contextual security responses that successfully block prompt injection, system extraction, and social engineering while preserving natural dialogue flow.<br>
                  • Developed novel Security Explanation Agent that generates contextual, personality-consistent responses for blocked content instead of robotic security messages, enhancing UX while maintaining comprehensive security.<br>
                  • Built secure backend infrastructure using FastAPI (Python), Gunicorn, Nginx reverse proxy, and Cloudflare Workers for API gateway isolation with session-based rate limiting and real-time monitoring.<br>
                  • Deployed full-stack system on self-managed Hetzner VPS, handling bare-metal Linux setup, SSL provisioning via Let’s Encrypt, server hardening, key management, and backend service orchestration.<br>
                  • Integrated Cloudflare DNS and proxying to shield origin server, separate public API keys from client-side code, and securely serve the application globally with conversation persistence using SQLite.<br>
                  • Managed deployment flows through direct server-side Git integration and shell-based service reloads with frontend hosted via GitHub Pages connecting dynamically to backend APIs through serverless Cloudflare Worker routing.<br>
                  • Full ownership across AI system architecture, security engineering, conversational UX design, multi-layer backend security, server provisioning, deployment orchestration, and API integration.<br>
