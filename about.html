                    Hi! I'm <strong>Edward He</strong>, a Computer Science graduate from Cornell University with a specialization in applied AI systems, full-stack backend engineering, and operational cloud infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to technical projects, I worked as a Teaching Assistant where I helped lead coursework in computer science fundamentals, refining my ability to communicate technical topics clearly and mentor peers — skills that directly complement my engineering work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most recently, I independently designed and deployed an AI-powered personal assistant system capable of answering complex, contextually grounded queries about my career, projects, and personal journey. This system combines multi-agent reasoning pipelines, intent classification, persona switching, and vector-embedding semantic retrieval — orchestrated through LangChain and LangGraph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I fully managed the deployment stack on a self-managed Hetzner VPS, building secure backend infrastructure using FastAPI, Gunicorn, Nginx reverse proxy, and Cloudflare Workers for isolated API gatewaying. Deployment flows, server hardening, SSL management (Let's Encrypt), and DNS-level security were handled entirely at the system level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hands-on approach provided end-to-end experience across software engineering, AI architecture, backend API design, server infrastructure, and production-grade deployment.
                </p>
